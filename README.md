# GreenGuard
H-DIP Comp Science - IOT Assignment 

# Initial Committ
Project Proposal.docx outling the Project Proposed

# Committ of Moisture.py
This file contained the initial code for Moisture Sensor using Digital Output using 
the GPIO functions of the RaspberryPi and Wia Functionality.
Not used in final revision.

# Committ of Moisture_ThingSpeak.py
This version contained the code for Moisture Sensor Digital Output using the GPIO functions of the RaspberryPi
but using ThingSpeak for the IOT Applicaiton as Wia was too unreliable
Not used in final revision.

# Committ of Moisture_SPI.py
This version contained the code for Moisture Sensor Analog Output using the Serial Peripheral Interface on the 
Raspberry PI and ThingSpeak functionality

# Committ of Updated Data Flow Diagram
Updated data flow diagram replacing the Wia applicaiton with ThingSpeak

#Committ of Project Submission doc.
